## Definition 
Assume that you are a professor and you'll give your students letter grades according to their scores. 
The score is calculated as follows: 30% of the 1st exam grade + 30% of the 2nd exam grade + 40% of the 3rd exam grade. 
The letter grades corresponding to the score intervals are listed in the below table: 
| Letter Grade | Score Interval                  |

| AA           | 90-100                          | 
| BA           | 85-89                           | 
| BB           | 80-84                           | 
| CB           | 75-79                           |
